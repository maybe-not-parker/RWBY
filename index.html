        <p>The story takes place in the world of Remnant, which is filled with supernatural forces and shadowy creatures known as the Grimm. Prior to the events of the series, mankind waged a battle of survival against the Grimm before discovering the power of a mysterious element called Dust, which allowed them to fight back against the monsters. In the present day, Dust is used to power abilities and weapons. Those who use these abilities to battle the Grimm are known as Huntsmen and Huntresses. The series focuses on four girls, each with her own unique weapon and powers. Together, they form a team at Beacon Academy in the city of Vale, where they are trained to become Huntresses.</p>

                Jeff Williams (the composer) and his daughter Casey Lee Williams (who was only 13 when she sang the soundtrack for Volume 1 of RWBY) have made some pretty good music for RWBY. Ordinarily, the genre of the soundtrack is rock. However, they have produced a few pop songs and a couple of slow ballads. Most notably, "Cold" was made in honor of the late Monty Oum. (The creator of RWBY)

                What's impressive about the fight animations is that, for a majority of the scenes, Monty Oum worked on them by himself. The reason why the choreography is so fluid is that Monty Oum was a pretty good dancer himself, which gave him a better understanding of the momentum and fluidity of the character's movement.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs4R-6D09Zk" style="color: skyblue"> Click me!</a> Additionally, most of the scenes flow in rhythm to the music. Furthermore, the music helps elevate the scenes to create hype moments. For example, in the Rwby versus the Nevermore fight, when Nora was launched into the air, as she started to decelerate, the music stopped before it kicked back up as she was freefalling. Then when Ren passed out, the lyrics were, "I couldn't take it, I couldn't stand another minute." Finally, the music paused once more before she launched towards the Nevermore, then it picked back up as she's flying through the air with rose petals behind her and the lyrics saying "red like roses." I mean, it's just really cool.

            The biggest problem of RWBY is the writing. Initially, Monty Oam was concerned that having a story about four teenage girls written by three adult men may cause an issue. However, against his better judgment, he went through with the idea anyway. The fight scenes are where a lot of character development or visual storytelling happens (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id0tja1Y6vY" style="color: skyblue">Pyrrha vs Mercury's</a> fight scene. In this scene, Mercury was trying to figure out what Pyrrha's semblance is. This is a good example of exposition because of how the visuals helped get that point across. After this, they went back to uninteresting exposition.) However, the events that transpired prior to and after falters due to Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross' writing. While RWBY has a lot of good ideas, it falls into the execution of those ideas. For example, the tombstone in the “Red” trailer had no story significance, but Monty just thought it was cool. When Jeff Williams asked Monty about it, Monty replied, "I don't know. We just thought it would be cool if she visited a grave". Jeff went on to ask "What if it's her mom?" to which Monty answered, "That's cool". <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SF1HJlwiww#t=23m" style="color: skyblue">Source</a>
